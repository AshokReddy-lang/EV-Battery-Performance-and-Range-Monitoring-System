#Project Description

This project is an interactive web application built using Flask that embeds Tableau dashboards to visualize electric vehicle charging patterns, battery performance, and driving range analysis.

The main objective of this project is to understand the relationship between battery capacity, charging behavior, and vehicle efficiency using interactive dashboards.

# EV-Battery-Performance-and-Range-Monitoring-System
Accurate electric vehicle range analysis is crucial for optimizing trip planning, reducing range anxiety, and improving energy efficiency. By leveraging data analytics, this project identifies key factors affecting range, predicts achievable distances, and provides actionable insights to support drivers,and charging infrastructure planning.
